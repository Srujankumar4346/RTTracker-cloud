✅ PROJECT SUMMARY
REAL-TIME OBJECT TRACKING WITH VISION-BASED AI ANALYTICS
🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a real-time object detection and tracking system using deep learning techniques. The system detects multiple objects in images, videos, and live webcam streams using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and OpenCV.

🚀 Core Idea of the Project

Traditional object detection systems are slow because they:

Process images in multiple stages

Use region proposal methods

Perform repeated classification

This project uses YOLO, a regression-based deep learning algorithm that:

Processes the entire image in a single pass

Predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously

Works in real-time (~45 FPS)
